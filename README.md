C++ GUI to read and process in Real Time EEG data collected with Biosemi System

This GUI is meant read and analyze EEG Biosemi data in real time. The executable file Real_Time_Biosemi_Cpp is located in the zip folder x64 -> Release. Unfortunately, Microsoft refuses to ackowledge and fix a problem in the C++/CLI module of Visual Studio that prevents the executable file to be used in a computer that doesn not have VS. As a consequence of this, please, keep in mind that in order to run the executable file, you will need to install Visual Studio with the C++/CLI module. Luckily, the software is free.

I upaloded a pdf file named "Guide to Real Time Biosemi" that provides a quick and simple guide to use the Real Time Biosemi GUI. I hope I was able to describe everything clearly.

If you have any question and/or want to report bugs, please e-mail me (Ale) at: pressalex@hotmail.com
