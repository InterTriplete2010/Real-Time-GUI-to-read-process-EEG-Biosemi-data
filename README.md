# Real-Time-GUI-to-read-process-EEG-Biosemi-data
C++ GUI to read and process in Real Time EEG data collected with Biosemi System

This GUI is meant read and analyze EEG Biosemi data in real time. The executable file Real_Time_Biosemi_Cpp is located in x64 -> Release. You will need to copy and paste the libraries blas_win64_MT.dll and lapack_win64_MT.dll into this folder, otherwise the executable won't be able to find the libraries. Please, keep in mind that in order to run the executable file, you will need to install Visual Studio. However, the software engineers at Microsoft said that "A fix for this issue has been internally implemented and is being prepared for release". Once it is released, I will upload the new executable file that should not require the installation of Visual Studio

I upaloded a pdf file named "Guide to Real Time Biosemi" that provides a quick and simple guide to use the Real Time Biosemi GUI. I hope I was able to describe everything clearly.

If you have any question and/or want to report bugs, please e-mail me (Ale) at: pressalex@hotmail.com
