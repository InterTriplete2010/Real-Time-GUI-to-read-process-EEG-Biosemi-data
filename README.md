# Real-Time-GUI-to-read-process-EEG-Biosemi-data
C++ GUI to read and process in Real Time EEG data collected with Biosemi System

This GUI is meant read and analyze EEG Biosemi data in real time. The executable file Real_Time_Biosemi_Cpp is located in x64 -> Release.
Please, note that due to the research restrictions imposed by the University of Maryland because of covid19, it was not possible to test this GUI with participants. Electrodes were connected to Biosemi and environmental noise (predominantly 60 Hz) was recorded.
I upaloded a pdf file named "Guide to Real Time Biosemi" that provides a quick and simple guide to use the Real Time Biosemi GUI. I hope I was able to describe everything clearly.
